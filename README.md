# Free Firm Site

**Demo: [freefirmsite.com](https://www.freefirmsite.com)**

## Overview

A free law firm website template built by [@digitallawyer](https://www.twitter.com/digitallawyer) using freely available software by Microsoft. 

* A complete, customizable law firm website.
* Mobile responsive and blazing fast.
* Completely free to use.
* Easy to customize.
* Fast to deploy.

The Free Firm Site template comes with the following pages:

* A clean home page.
* A page listing the attorneys in your firm.
* A page providing an overview of your firm's services.
* An about page.
* A contact page.

## Setup

Setting up and customizing this website is easy, and requires only a minimum level of technical expertise. To do so, you will need to:

* Create a Github account (if you do not already have one)
* Make a copy of this website (also referred to as 'forking this repository')
* Customize the variables, such as the name of your law firm (by editing the `config.yml` file).
* Add information about the attorneys in your firm (by editing the `attorneys.yml` file).
* Add services your firm offers (by editing the `services.yml` file).
* Connect the website to your domain name.

The whole setup process can be performed in less than an hour. Because hosting on Github pages is free, the only cost involved is the annual renewal fee of the domain name you choose. The end-result is a professional law firm website that is blazing-fast, works on desktop and mobile, and is incredibly cost-effective.

### Create a github account

First, you will need to create a Github account. Github is owned by Microsoft and is used by developers to store and track changes to software code. Think about it as track changes but for software code. If you already have a Github account, you can skip this step. If you do not yet have a Github account, go to [github.com](https://www.github.com) to get started.

To do so, go to [https://github.com/digitallawyer/freefirmsite](https://github.com/digitallawyer/freefirmsite) and click the "Fork" button located at the top right of the page. By "Forking" a repository, you are making a copy of the original website, in your Github account.
