# Free Firm Site

**Demo: [freefirmsite.com](https://www.freefirmsite.com)**

## Overview

A free law firm website template built by [@digitallawyer](https://www.twitter.com/digitallawyer) using freely available software by Microsoft. 

* A complete, customizable law firm website.
* Mobile responsive and blazing fast.
* Completely free to use.
* Easy to customize.
* Fast to deploy.

The Free Firm Site template comes with the following pages:

* A clean home page.
* A page listing the attorneys in your firm.
* A page providing an overview of your firm's services.
* An about page.
* A contact page.

## Setup

Setting up and customizing this website is easy, and requires only a minimum level of technical expertise. To do so, you will need to:

* Create a Github account (if you do not already have one)
* Make a copy of this website (also referred to as 'forking this repository')
* Customize the variables, such as the name of your law firm (by editing the `config.yml` file).
* Add information about the attorneys in your firm (by editing the `attorneys.yml` file).
* Add services your firm offers (by editing the `services.yml` file).
* Connect the website to your domain name.

The whole setup process can be performed in less than an hour. Because hosting on Github pages is free, the only cost involved is the annual renewal fee of the domain name you choose. The end-result is a professional law firm website that is blazing-fast, works on desktop and mobile, and is incredibly cost-effective.

### Create a github account

First, you will need to **create a Github account**. Github is owned by Microsoft and is used by developers to store and track changes to software code. Think about it as track changes but for software code. If you already have a Github account, you can skip this step. If you do not yet have a Github account, go to [github.com](https://www.github.com) to get started.

### Make a copy of this website

Once you have created and are logged in to your github account, you can make a copy of the demo website. To do so, go to [https://github.com/digitallawyer/freefirmsite](https://github.com/digitallawyer/freefirmsite) and click the "**Fork**" button located at the top right of the page. By "Forking" a repository, you are making a copy of the original website, in your Github account.

### See it in action

Congrats! You now have your own, personal copy of the Free Firm Site repository. Github allows you to host your website, for free, on Github Pages. To do so, click the "**Settings**"" button on your repository page.

![Go to settings](/assets/images/_readme/rm3.png "Go to settings")

Scroll down until you see the **Github Pages** section. Click on the "Source" button and select "master branch". This tells Github that you would like to use Github Pages, and that Github Pages should show your visitors the code in the main branch of your repository.

![Enable Github Pages](/assets/images/_readme/rm4.png "Enable Github Pages")

As soon as you enable Github pages, your website will start building, and Github will make it available online. The settings page will show the url at which the site is available, and you should be able to visit your website moments later.
