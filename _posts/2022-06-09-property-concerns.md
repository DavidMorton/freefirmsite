Why do I need a will if everything I own automatically goes to my spouse and children?

Does it, though?

There are two basic types of property: **Separate Property** (property that only you own) and **Community Property** (property that you own with your spouse – each spouse owning half).

Texas is a Community Property state, meaning that everything purchased and acquired (except by gift or devise) *during* the marriage is Community Property. On the other hand, anything purchased and acquired *before* the marriage and any gifts or inheritances received at *any time* (before or during the marriage) is Separate Property (Think: oil royalties from your late great aunt, proceeds from the sale of your late mother’s home).

If you die without a will in Texas, the Texas Estates Code determines which of your heirs receives your Separate Property and Community Property (Hint: not everything automatically passes to your spouse or children.)

If you die without a will in Texas, where your property goes depends on the answers to two main questions:
1) **What is your family situation?** (Married? Single? Children of the marriage? Children from a previous relationship?); and 
2) **Is the property in question Community Property or Separate Property?**

If you are married in Texas, you own a half-share of the Community Property and your spouse owns the other half. Your surviving spouse will retain his/her share. The question is what happens to your half-share.

## If you die without a will, the Texas Estates Code determines what happens to your property

### If you are **married** and all children are *also* children of your surviving spouse

*	Community Property: all to surviving spouse
*	Separate Personal Property: 1/3 to surviving spouse and 2/3 divided equally among the children.
*	Separate Real Property: life estate in 1/3 to surviving spouse and remainder distributed to the children. In the real world, this can be a complicated and is an often undesirable situation.

### If you are **married** and some of your children are *not* children of your surviving spouse
* Community Property: your half goes to your children, not to your surviving spouse; your surviving spouse retains his/her half 
* Separate Personal Property: 1/3 to surviving spouse and 2/3 divided equally among the children.
* Separate Real Property: life estate in 1/3 to surviving spouse and remainder distributed to the children. In the real world, this can be a complicated and is an often undesirable situation.

### If you are **married** and have *no* children
* Community Property: all to surviving spouse 
* Separate Personal property: all to surviving spouse
* Separate Real Property: half to your surviving spouse and half divided among your parents and/or siblings (depending on which parents and siblings survive you).

### If you are **unmarried** and have children
* All property to your children.
If you are unmarried and have no children
* All property to your parents and/or siblings (depending on which parents and siblings survive you)
